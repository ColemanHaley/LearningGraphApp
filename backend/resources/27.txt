CHAPTER 27 Phonetics characters letters basis text-based methods seen far book just random symbols . amazing scientific invention : theoretical model elements make up human speech . earliest independently invented writing systems ( Sumerian , Chinese , Mayan ) mainly logographic , means symbol representing whole word . earliest stages find , symbols represent sounds make up words . Thus , cuneiform sign right pronounced ba meaning “ ration ” Sumerian function purely sound / ba / languages cuneiform . Chinese writing , early instan - tiations oracle bones , assigns phonetic meaning many character elements . Purely sound-based writing systems , syllabic ( like Japanese hiragana katakana ) , alphabetic ( like Roman alphabet book ) , consonantal ( like Semitic writing systems ) , generally traced back early logo - syllabic systems , often two cultures came together . Thus , Arabic , Aramaic , Hebrew , Greek , Roman systems derive West Semitic script pre - sumed modified Western Semitic mercenaries cursive form Egyptian hieroglyphs . Japanese syllabaries modified cursive form set Chinese characters represented sounds . Chinese charac - ters themselves Chinese phonetically represent Sanskrit Buddhist scriptures brought China Tang dynasty . Whatever origins , idea implicit sound-based writing system — spoken word composed smaller units speech — underlies modern algorithms speech recognition ( transcribing acoustic waveforms strings text words ) speech synthesis text-to-speech ( converting strings text words acoustic waveforms ) . chapter introduce phonetics computational perspective .

Sounds made vocal folds together vibrating called voiced ; sounds made vocalvoiced sound cord vibration called unvoiced voiceless . Voiced sounds include [ b ] , [ d ] , [ g ] , unvoiced sound [ v ] , [ z ] , English vowels , among others . Unvoiced sounds include [ p ] , [ t ] , [ k ] , [ f ] , [ s ] , others . area trachea called vocal tract ; consists oral tract nasal tract . air leaves trachea , exit body mouth nose . sounds made air passing mouth .

Semivow - els ( [ y ] [ w ] ) properties ; voiced like vowels , short less syllabic like consonants . 27.2.2 Consonants : Place Articulation consonants made restricting airflow way , consonants distinguished restriction made : point maximum restriction called consonant . Places articulation , shown Fig . 27.4 , aplace ofarticulation useful way grouping phones equivalence classes , described below . Labial : Consonants whose main restriction formed two lips coming to-labial gether bilabial place articulation . English include [ p ] possum , [ b ] bear , [ m ] marmot . English labiodental 27.2 • ARTICULATORY PHONETICS 5 ( nasal tract ) dental bilabial glottal palatal velar alveolar Figure 27.4 Major English places articulation . consonants [ v ] [ f ] made pressing bottom lip against upper row teeth letting air flow space upper teeth . Dental : Sounds made placing tongue against teeth dentals . dental main dentals English [ th ] thing [ dh ] though , made placing tongue behind teeth tip slightly teeth . Alveolar : alveolar ridge portion roof mouth just behind thealveolar upper teeth . speakers American English make phones [ s ] , [ z ] , [ t ] , [ d ] placing tip tongue against alveolar ridge . word coronal often refer dental alveolar . Palatal : roof mouth ( palate ) rises sharply back thepalatal palate alveolar ridge . palato-alveolar sounds [ sh ] ( shrimp ) , [ ch ] ( china ) , [ zh ] ( Asian ) , [ jh ] ( jar ) made blade tongue against rising back alveolar ridge . palatal sound [ y ] yak made placing front tongue up close palate . Velar : velum , soft palate , movable muscular flap back thevelar roof mouth . sounds [ k ] ( cuckoo ) , [ g ] ( goose ) , [ N ] ( kingfisher ) made pressing back tongue up against velum . Glottal : glottal stop [ q ] ( IPA [ P ] ) made closing glottis ( bringingglottal vocal folds together ) . 27.2.3 Consonants : Manner Articulation Consonants distinguished restriction airflow made , ex - ample , complete stoppage air partial blockage . feature called manner articulation consonant . combination place mannermanner ofarticulation articulation usually sufficient uniquely identify consonant . Following major manners articulation English consonants : stop consonant airflow completely blocked short time . stop blockage followed explosive sound air released . period blockage called closure , explosion called release . English voiced stops like [ b ] , [ d ] , [ g ] well unvoiced stops like [ p ] , [ t ] , [ k ] . Stops called plosives . nasal sounds [ n ] , [ m ] , [ ng ] made lowering velum allow-nasal ing air pass nasal cavity . fricatives , airflow constricted cut off completely . turbulentfricatives airflow results constriction produces characteristic “ hissing ” sound . English labiodental fricatives [ f ] [ v ] produced pressing lower lip against upper teeth , allowing restricted airflow upper teeth . 6 CHAPTER 27 • PHONETICS dental fricatives [ th ] [ dh ] allow air flow around tongue teeth . alveolar fricatives [ s ] [ z ] produced tongue against alveolar ridge , forcing air edge teeth . palato-alveolar fricatives [ sh ] [ zh ] , tongue back alveolar ridge , forcing air groove formed tongue . higher-pitched fricatives ( English [ s ] , [ z ] , [ sh ] [ zh ] ) called sibilants . Stops followed immediately fricatives aresibilants called affricates ; include English [ ch ] ( chicken ) [ jh ] ( giraffe ) . approximants , two articulators close together close enough toapproximant cause turbulent airflow . English [ y ] ( yellow ) , tongue moves close roof mouth close enough cause turbulence characterize fricative . English [ w ] ( wood ) , back tongue comes close velum . American [ r ] formed least two ways ; just tip tongue extended close palate whole tongue bunched up near palate . [ l ] formed tip tongue up against alveolar ridge teeth , sides tongue lowered allow air flow . [ l ] called lateral sound drop sides tongue . tap flap [ dx ] ( IPA [ R ] ) quick motion tongue against alveolartap ridge . consonant middle word lotus ( [ l ow dx ax s ] ) tap dialects American English ; speakers many U.K . dialects [ t ] tap word . 27.2.4 Vowels Like consonants , vowels characterized position articulators made . three relevant parameters vowels called vowel height , correlates roughly height highest part tongue , vowel frontness backness , indicating high point toward front back oral tract shape lips rounded . Figure 27.5 shows position tongue different vowels . boot [ uw ] closed velum bat [ ae ] palate beet [ iy ] tongue Figure 27.5 Positions tongue three English vowels : high front [ iy ] , low front [ ae ] high back [ uw ] . vowel [ iy ] , example , highest point tongue toward front mouth . vowel [ uw ] , contrast , high-point tongue located toward back mouth . Vowels tongue raised toward front called front vowels ; tongue raised toward theFront vowel back called back vowels . Note [ ih ] [ eh ] front vowels , Back vowel tongue higher [ ih ] [ eh ] . Vowels highest point tongue comparatively high called high vowels ; vowels mid low valuesHigh vowel maximum tongue height called mid vowels low vowels , respectively .

Note chart two kinds vowels : tongue height represented point represented path . vowel tongue position changes markedly production vowel diphthong . En-diphthong glish particularly rich diphthongs . second important articulatory dimension vowels shape lips . Certain vowels pronounced lips rounded ( same lip shape whistling ) . rounded vowels include [ uw ] , [ ao ] , [ ow ] . rounded vowel 27.2.5 Syllables Consonants vowels combine make syllable . syllable vowel-like ( orsyllable sonorant ) sound together surrounding consonants closely associated . word dog syllable , [ d aa g ] ( dialect ) ; word catnip two syllables , [ k ae t ] [ n ih p ] . call vowel core syllable nucleus . optional initial consonant set consonantsnucleus called onset . onset consonant ( word strikeonset [ s t r ay k ] ) , say complex onset . coda optional consonant orcoda sequence consonants following nucleus . Thus [ d ] onset dog , [ g ] coda . rime , rhyme , nucleus plus coda .

Syllable structure closely related phonotactics language . Thesyllabification term phonotactics means constraints phones follow inphonotactics language . example , English strong constraints kinds conso - nants appear together onset ; sequence [ zdr ] , example , legal English syllable onset . Phonotactics represented language model finite-state model phone sequences . 27.3 Prosodic Prominence : Accent , Stress Schwa natural utterance American English , words sound prominent thanprominence others , certain syllables words prominent others . mean prominence words syllables perceptually salient listener ; speakers make word syllable salient English saying louder , saying slower ( longer duration ) , varying F0 word , making higher variable . capture core notion prominence associating linguistic marker prominent words syllables , marker called pitch accent . Words syllables thatpitch accent prominent bear ( associated ) pitch accent . Pitch accent thus part phonological description word context spoken utterance . Thus utterance might pronounced accenting underlined words : ( 27.1 ) little surprised hear characterized happy . Nuclear Accent generally need fine-grained distinctions just binary distinction - tween accented unaccented words . example , last accent phrase gen - erally perceived prominent accents . prominent last accent called nuclear emphatic accent . Emphatic accents generallyemphaticaccent semantic purposes , marking word focus sentence contrastive otherwise important way . emphatic words often written CAPITAL LETTERS * * stars * * around texts email Alice Wonderland ; here’s example latter : ( 27.2 ) “ know SOMETHING interesting sure happen , ” herself . Lexical Stress syllables bear pitch accent called accented syllables , every syllable word accented . Pitch accent realized syllable lexical stress . Lexical stress property words ’ pronunciation inlexical stress dictionaries ; syllable lexical stress louder longer word accented . example , word surprised stressed second syllable , first . ( try stressing syllable saying SURprised ; hopefully sounds wrong ) . Thus , word surprised receives pitch accent sentence , second syllable stronger . following example shows underlined accented words stressed syllable bearing accent ( louder , longer syllable ) boldface : ( 27.3 ) little surprised hear characterized happy . 27.4 • PROSODIC STRUCTURE TUNE 9 Stress marked dictionaries various ways . CMU dictionary ( CMU , 1993 ) , example , marks vowel number 0 ( unstressed ) , 1 ( stressed ) , 2 ( secondary stress ) . Thus , word counter listed [ K AW1 N T ER0 ] word table [ T EY1 B AH0 L ] . secondary stress defined level ofsecondarystress stress lower primary stress higher unstressed vowel , word dictionary [ D IH1 K SH AH0 N EH2 R IY0 ] . Difference lexical stress affect word meaning . example word content noun adjective , different stressed syllables ( noun pronounced [ K AA1 N T EH0 N T ] adjective [ K AA0 N T EH1 N T ] ) . IPA , hand , symbol [ " ] syllable indicates lexical stress ( e.g . , [ " par . sli ] ) . Reduced Vowels Schwa Vowels unstressed weakened even further reduced vowels . Thereduced vowel common reduced vowel schwa ( [ ax ] ) . Reduced vowels English haveschwa full form ; articulatory gesture complete full vowel . result , shape mouth somewhat neutral ; tongue neither particularly high nor low . second vowel parakeet schwa : [ p ae r ax k iy t ] . schwa common reduced vowel , , least dialects ( Bolinger , 1981 ) . Besides [ ax ] , ARPAbet includes reduced front vowel [ ix ] ( IPA [ 1 ] ) , well [ axr ] , r-colored schwa ( often called schwar ) . 1 Fig . 27.8 shows reduced vowels .

Inprosody language processing , , term prosody mean study intonational rhythmic aspects language . technically , prosody defined Ladd ( 1996 ) “ suprasegmental features convey sentence - level pragmatic meanings ” . term suprasegmental means beyond thesuprasegmental 1 [ ix ] generally dropped computational applications ( Miller , 1998 ) , [ ax ] [ ix ] falling together many dialects English ( Wells , 1982 , p . 167 – 168 ) . 10 CHAPTER 27 • PHONETICS level segment phone . term refers especially acoustic features like F0 , duration , energy independently phone string . sentence-level pragmatic meaning , Ladd referring number kinds meaning relation sentence discourse external context . example , prosody mark discourse structure function , like difference statements questions , way conversation structured segments subdialogs . Prosody mark saliency , indicating particular word phrase important salient . Finally , prosody heavily affective emotional meaning , expressing happiness , surprise , anger . kind prosodic prominence , saw prior section computational studied aspects prosody , two others introduce section : prosodic structure tune . 27.4.1 Prosodic Structure Spoken sentences prosodic structure sense words seem group naturally together words seem noticeable break dis - juncture . Prosodic structure often described terms prosodic phrasing , meaning utterance prosodic phrase structure similar wayprosodicphrasing syntactic phrase structure . example , sentence wanted go London , get tickets France seem two main - tonation phrases , boundary occurring comma . Furthermore , firstintonationphrase phrase , seems another set lesser prosodic phrase boundaries ( often called intermediate phrases ) split up words wanted | go | London . intermediatephrase correlation prosodic structure syntactic structure ( Price et al . 1991 , Ostendorf Veilleux 1994 , Koehn et al . 2000 ) . 27.4.2 Tune Two utterances same prominence phrasing patterns still differ prosodically different tunes . tune utterance rise andtune fall F0 time . obvious example tune difference statements yes-no questions English . same sentence final rise F0 indicate yes-no question , final fall F0 indicate declarative intonation . Figure 27.9 shows F0 track same words spoken question statement . Note question rises end ; often called question rise . falling intonation statement called final fall . question rise final fall Time ( s ) 0 0.922 P c h ( H z ) 50 250 know mean Time ( s ) 0 0.912 P c h ( H z ) 50 250 know mean ( ) ( b ) Figure 27.9 same text read statement know mean ( left ) question know mean ?

Besides well-known rise yes-no questions , English phrase containing list nouns 27.4 • PROSODIC STRUCTURE TUNE 11 separated commas often short rise called continuation rise eachcontinuationrise noun . examples include characteristic English contours expressing contradiction expressing surprise . mapping meaning tune English extremely complex . Con - sider utterance oh , really . varying phrasing stress , still possi - ble many variants varying intonational tune . example , might excited version oh , really ! ( context reply statement just won lottery ) ; sceptical version oh , really ? — context sure speaker honest ; angry oh , really ! indicating displeasure .

Roughly speaking , human pitch perception accurate 100 Hz 1000 Hz range pitch correlates linearly frequency . Hu - man hearing represents frequencies 1000 Hz less accurately , range , pitch correlates logarithmically frequency .
